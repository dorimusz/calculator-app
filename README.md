# Calculator app

It's a calculator application that uses React in client side and NodeJs/ExpressJs on server side.

### How it works
* Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two numbers. Use the num pad and operators.
* To get the result, click the button '='.
* After getting the result, by clicking 'SAVE' the full operation will be saved in a file (right now the response is only in console)
* After clicking '=' and/or 'SAVE' press button 'C' to clear out the display.
* By clicking 'MEM' the history will show up below the calculator.
